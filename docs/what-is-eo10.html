    <p>Ah, Windows 10. the one version of Windows they got right. Its ending. In October, 2025, Windows 10 will fall out of support. it will be prone to viruses. In a few years apps won't support it anymore.</p>
    <p>So its the end. Go hide under a rock now. OK get out from under the rock now. No, This isn't a sponsorship. I promise. I know there is a lot of people out there with Windows 10 PCs that can't upgrade.</p>
    <p>I know a person who won't upgrade. But you can... Go buy the latest M5 Macbook Pro for only 2,000$! (Don't buy it.) OR install linux on the computer for free. no 139$ Activation key. Just a USB, a computer, and an .iso.</p>
    <p>As I said above, I'm not being sponsered by them. I'm just writing this because I had PCs that couldn't upgrade. of course, I was scared of linux and used a workaround to upgrade. (Worth a search) But then I got sick of Windows. I installed linux on my surface pro. then my main piece of junk thats a snail.</p>
    <p>OK, End of Ten is a group who wants to help you install linux.</p>
