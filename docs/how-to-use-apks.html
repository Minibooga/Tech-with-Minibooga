    <p>What are APKs? (iPhone readers, run the other way, unless you want to get jealous.) NOTE: This may be different on 2026 and later, I'll try to update by then.</p>
    <p>APKs are useful little files that can install apps on your phone. (Or PC if you use android on there.) You click, press install and your done. Now, Google is going to do something to apks, make them harder to install. Really stupid.</p>
