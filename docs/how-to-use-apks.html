    <p>What are APKs? (iPhone readers, run the other way, unless you want to get jealous.) NOTE: This may be different on 2026 and later, I'll try to update by then.</p>
    <p>APKs are useful little files that can install apps on your phone. (Or PC if you use android on there.) You click, press install and your done. Now, Google is going to do something to apks, make them harder to install. Really stupid.</p>
    <p>Now, I want to point out that these files may be malware, as long as you know what you're doing your fine. Don't be like me who goes around on fishy sites looking for an outdated app. You can do that, but it is not fun to catch malware.</p>
    <p>iPhone users have this also, in the form of .ipa files, but I think you need to jailbreak the iPhone, or allow or something like that. This is why I like android phones. you tap the file, allow from unknown sources, and hit install. App installed. *GASP*</p>
    <p>With it you can install something like F-Droid, or Aurora Store. both alternate app stores. Don't like the F-Droid UI? Install Droidify, a F-Droid front-end. I use both, but mostly Droidify. Oh, did I mention you can code on android? Install Acode, and you have an IDE in your pocket. *MORE GASPS*</p>
    <p>Why am I writing this? I HATE IPHONE. No you in the back, Facetime does not impress me! Android can video call too. Ok, before I start going crazy, I will stop. Adios, fellow android users.</p>
