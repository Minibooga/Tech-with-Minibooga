                                      Why Google sucks.
  We all use google. I have an android phone. Guess what? Android is made by google. You have an iPhone. You might have google apps, or use the google search engine.
                                    But they are not doing it out of the "goodness" of there heart.</h1></head>

  <p>No, your eyes aren't fooling you. They do it to spy on you. alot. let's look at their search engine with ublock origin to see the trackers (P.S Ublock is showing me 106 trackers as i edit this file.)

  Thats the search homepage. What is we take a search?

  44 and its still going higher. If you don't believe me, install ublock origin (Ublock origin lite if you're on a chromium browser)
  and go to the search engine.
  Youtube is also google. The only reason i'm on there is because there's nowhere else to put it (I could put it on Rumble now that i think about it.)
  So yes. Google is bad. How 'bout android and google? Well, android is google's best weapon on phones. They put google maps, home, chrome, and a bunch of other junk.
  The only good thing the did on android is ADB and Fastboot.
  Alright class, today we learned google = doom and gloom.
  Thanks for reading.</p>
