    <p>Ah, linux. The OS everybody looks at but never touch.</p>
    <p>What is Linux? An OS, you can run .exe on it. No, apple user, you can't run .dmg. Linux uses .AppImage, .sh, and unix exe or something like that.</p>
    <p>But linux isn't for everybody. I used Windows for a long time before linux. Switching isn't that hard. Unless you need the full adobe suite, then you should be fine on linux.</p>
    <p>Need Notepad? use vim or Kate. Need VSCode? Download it or use VSCodium. Need Photoshop? use GIMP. Trust me, there are plenty of alteritives.</p>
    <p>And unless your an apple dev, you don't need Windows or MacOS. You can code C++, HTML+CSS+Javascript, Koltin for Android Devs, in fact, Linux is the best OS for developers.</p>
    <p>And trust me, you don't need to touch the terminal too much. (It's better to use the terminal.) You can install something like Ubuntu, or Linux Mint.</p>
    <p>You don't need to install Arch Linux. If you want to dip your feet in arch linux, use Endevor OS, or if your a gamer, you can use Dr460nized.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
