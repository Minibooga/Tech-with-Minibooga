  <h1>Ah, Good old Windows. Execpt it wasn't good, and very old. I'm going to talk about why i dont use Windows. 
</head>

    <p>Everybody knows what Windows is. It's the thing that runs on a computer with the black bar and the little window icon, and adobe photoshop.
      But that OS isn't all rainbows and lolipops (Sorry Windows, no lolipops).</p>
    <p>First of all, it's the main target for malware devs. ex. MyDoom, ILOVEYOU, WANACRYPT. Those three viruses targeted Windows. But linux doesn't have as much malware. (Yes, I had linux malware before, and not from the AUR.)
    </p>
    <p>Second, it's spyware. They collect a lot of data. If you don't beleive me, STOP READING NOW.</p>
    <p>And third: It's bad for devs. you try to code C++, NO, you have to install VScode or something, then it works, right? Nope, you need to install a C compiler, now your done, right? NO, you aren't done, you have to set up the C compiler to PATH then configure VScode for that compiler.</p>
    <p>OK, so now we understand that Windpws is bad. Thank you for reading my rant.</p>
